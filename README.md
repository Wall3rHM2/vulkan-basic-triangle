# vulkan-basic-triangle
 A basic and simple as possible render for Vulkan that draws a triangle

# What is Vulkan?
 Vulkan is a graphics API just like OpenGL and DirectX, except it is insanely more complex, thus what would be a simple
 code in OpenGL and Direct3D 9 such as a single basic triangle, requires like 800-1000 lines of coding in Vulkan. Vulkan
 also support multiple platforms and at the moment is the best API when it comes to optimization and performance.

## Requirements
 Create a environment variable named VULKAN_SDK that contains your vulkan sdk directory including version, eg: "C:\VulkanSDK\1.3.224.1"
 
 Download glfw x64 and put it inside the "external" folder, name it "glfw64"

At the moment there is not gonna be a official linux support because I don't have enough space to run this on linux to test lmao
